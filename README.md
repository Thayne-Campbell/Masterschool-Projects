Hey! I'm Thayne! Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! I'm a dedicated data analyst with a strong passion for transforming complex datasets into compelling visual stories. I thrive on the excitement of uncovering hidden insights and making meaningful connections within the numbers.

With a keen eye for detail and a creative mindset, I specialize in crafting eye-catching visualizations that bring data to life. I believe that effective visual representations not only enhance understanding but also have the power to engage and captivate audiences. I take pride in my ability to distill complex information into intuitive charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards that empower decision-makers to extract actionable intelligence.
