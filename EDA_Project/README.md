# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
## by Thayne Campbell


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others from 2005 to 2014.


## Summary of Findings

>Through Univariate exploration, I was able to find helpful information such as the median loan amount, the number of loans taken out within different income ranges, the number of loans per state, the more popular types of loans being taken out, and the distribution of borrower's interest rates. This laid a strong foundation for a more in depth look at the effect that different factors have on borrower's loan amounts and interest rates.

>With Bivariate exploration, I got a better look at the relationships between loan amounts and borrower interest rates, interest rates based on the type of loan, interest rates based on employment status and income range, as well as the effect of home ownership on the number of loans and their respective rates. I was also able to get a glimpse at state wide interest rates across the US.

>Finally, through Multivariate exploration, I was able to dive deeper into what was the cause of higher (or lower) interest rates across key states, I found the relationship between loan types and income ranges and how interest rates are affected by both, I was able to see a strenghthened relationship between loan amounts vs interest rates when comparing income ranges, and I got a better picture at the effect that home ownership had on a borrowers interest rates.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The key insights I will focus on for this presentation will be the effects of income range,loan amount, and loan type on borrower interest rates, as well as the impact of home ownership on borrowing.
